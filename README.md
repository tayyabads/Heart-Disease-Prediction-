# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
Overview

This repository contains a Heart Disease Prediction Model built using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on various health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. This project is a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding key factors associated with heart disease risk.

Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset contains both categorical and continuous variables. Outliers in continuous variables have been handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations and statistical techniques have been employed to uncover patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (heart disease).

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression: Used for initial classification.
Decision Tree and Random Forest: Implemented for comparison.
User Input Prediction: The model allows users to input key health parameters, and it predicts whether the person is likely to have heart disease or not.
Usage
Training the Model: You can retrain the model on the dataset provided or use a different dataset with the same structure.
Prediction: Use the pre-trained model to predict heart disease based on new inputs.
